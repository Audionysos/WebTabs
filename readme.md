TODO:

- Figure out how to get rid of this annoying puzzle icon ![](docs/puzzle_icon.PNG)

  - Would been also nice to be able to append to a file
- ****** Figure out how to start normal chrome instead of canary version.
- Check how to compile/pack the chrome extension.
- Specify system-default program to run the `.tabs` files
- Write docs for the configuration.
- Add actual configuration file
  - change target program (browser) path
  - opening preview
- Convert icon to support multiple sizes (current icon looks really bad in when small)
